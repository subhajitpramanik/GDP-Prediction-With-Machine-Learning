Hi there, I hope you have seen the video or the report.

Here are some basic instructions while running the code, if you wish ðŸ˜€:

1. Please run the code on colab
2. There are two .ipynb files. One is the main code and another is code for the
web application.
3. Before running please change the path way of the file or upload it in the colab.
4. If you run the gdp_predictor_web_app.ipynb, then please upload the data file 
first and then run it on Colab. There will be a link on the output of the last snippet.
Go to that link and click on "Click to Continue" button. This will open the "GDP
Calculator". If the page does not open then please refresh it once or twice.
***The link will be valid until the code run continously.
5. The values of the R2 score and RMSE can be different if you run the code.
